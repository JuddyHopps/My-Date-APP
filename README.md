Welcome to **DokiCupid**, a dating app designed for anime characters!

DokiCupid is a clone of the popular dating site OkCupid. The Japanese term *"doki-doki"* describes the sound of one's beating heart and is often used to express excited feelings of love. 

DokiCupid features **user profiles, matchmaking, filtered search, and instant-messaging** between users. 

This application utilizes Rails and Postgres on the back-end, and React/Redux to manage the front-end. 

*Note: DokiCupid was a two-week project submitted as part of App Academy's full-stack curriculum.*

## Homepage (Doubletake)
After logging in, users are greeted with the **Doubletake** page which displays profile previews for users that the current user has not yet matched with. Users can see their match percentage with each displayed user and have the option to visit that user's profile.

## Explore and Search
The **Explore** page gives previews of all user profiles for users who are not yet matched with the current user, along with the distance from and compatibility rating with each user. 

The **Search** page allows a user to filter prospective matches by tags including specific personality traits, gender identification, and what the other user is "looking for" on this app. Multiple tags may be specified at one time, and the results will display users that meet all of these requirements. Users can also choose to sort these results by compatibility percentage in increasing or decreasing order.

A majority of my React components relied on knowing who the current user was already matched with, who they had previously "liked", and which users had "liked" them, in order to decide which information would be displayed. If the state did not already hold this information, a `GET` request was made to `/api/matches`.

```ruby
# app/controllers/api/matches_controller.rb
class Api::MatchesController < ApplicationController
  def index  
    @matched_users = current_user.matched_users
    @who_liked_you = current_user.requesting_users
    @who_you_liked = current_user.requested_users
  end
end 
```
The methods above called on `current_user` refer to methods I defined on the `User` model, such as the following:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def matches 
    Match.where(
      "(user_id = ? OR requested_user_id = ?) AND is_matched = ?",
      self.id, self.id, true
    )
  end 
  
  def matched_users 
    matches = self.matches
    matched_users = []
    matches.each do |match|
      if match.user_id == self.id 
        matched_users << User.find(match.requested_user_id)
      else 
        matched_users << User.find(match.user_id)
      end
    end
    matched_users
  end
end
```

## User Profiles 
When visiting one's own profile page, a user can choose to view, edit, or delete their profile. When editing, users can also attach more photos for their profile or delete any existing photos.

When users visit other users' profiles, they can "like", or request to be matched with, the user they are viewing. If the requested user chooses to "like" them back, a match is created which allows the two users to send messages to one another.

## Matches and Messaging
At the **Matches** page, users can see who they are currently matched with, who they "liked", and who "liked" them. When two users mutually "like" each other, the match is created, and one of the users can start a conversation with the other on the **Messages** page. Real-time chat between matched users is implemented using Action Cable in Rails.

#### Handling Conversations 
Because only one conversation should exist in conversations table of the database for a pair of matched users, I wrote a scope method `:between` in the `Conversation` model to be used when attempting to create a conversation at the controller. If one already exists in the database, the existing one is returned; if an existing conversation is not found, the method creates a new conversation between the two users and returns that conversation.

```ruby
# app/controllers/api/conversations_controller.rb
def create
  if Conversation.between(
      conversation_params[:sender_id], conversation_params[:recipient_id]
    ).present?
    @conversation = Conversation.between(
      conversation_params[:sender_id],
      conversation_params[:recipient_id]
    ).first
  else
    @conversation = Conversation.create!(conversation_params)
  end
  render :show
end

```
```ruby
# app/models/conversation.rb
scope :between, -> (sender_id, recipient_id) do 
    where(
      "(conversations.sender_id = ? AND conversations.recipient_id = ?) OR (conversations.sender_id = ? AND conversations.recipient_id = ?)", 
      sender_id, recipient_id, recipient_id, sender_id
    )
end
```

#### Real-time Messaging 
One of the more challenging areas of this project was configuring Action Cable for real-time messaging.

In `MessagesChannel`, I defined a method `create` that takes in data and creates a message in the database with that data. Then, it broadcasts the `socket` object to the `"messages_channel"` referenced in the `subscribed` method.

```ruby
# app/channels/messages_channel.rb
class MessagesChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel  
  def subscribed
    stream_for 'messages_channel' 
  end

  def create(data) 
    message = Message.create(
      body: data["body"], 
      user_id: data["user_id"], 
      conversation_id: data["conversation_id"]
    )
    socket = { 
      id: message.id, 
      conversation_id: message.conversation_id, 
      body: message.body, 
      user_id: message.user_id, 
      read: message.read, 
      created_at: message.created_at 
    }
    MessagesChannel.broadcast_to("messages_channel", socket)
  end
end  
```

In the `MessageShow` component below, `this.createSocket` is called once the component mounts. `createSocket` then sets `this.messages` to be the subscription that is created. We set the channel to be the `MessagesChannel` shown above, and state that when we receive data (a new message), we want to add that message to `this.state.messageLogs` and `setState` to update what is displayed to the user. 

```javascript
// frontend/components/messages/messages_show.jsx
class MessagesShow extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
     this.createSocket();
  }
   
  createSocket() {
    this.messages = App.cable.subscriptions.create({
      channel: 'MessagesChannel'
    }, {
      connected: () => { },
      received: (data) => {
        let messageLogs = this.state.messageLogs;
        messageLogs.push(data);
        this.setState({ messageLogs: messageLogs })
      },
      create: function (messageContent) {
        this.perform('create', 
          messageContent
        );
      }
    });
  }
  
  handleSendEvent(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    this.messages.create({
      body: this.state.body, 
      conversation_id: this.state.conversationId, 
      user_id: this.state.userId
    });
    this.setState({ body: "" });
  }
}

```
I also defined a method `create` on `this.messages` which calls `handleSendEvent` with our new to-be-sent message. When the user hit the enter key or clicks the send button to submit their message, we call the `create` function passing in the `messageContent` we want to send to the `MessagesChannel`'s `create` method.

### Future Directions
1. Display errors for Profile Form create/edit, and other relevant errors (only login/signup errors currently)
1. Use Google Maps API for accurate distance calculation
1. Add more personality quiz questions for more specific compatibility ratings
1. Notifications for new messages, matches, and likes
1. Sign up by email and validate email before using site
